# 66DaysOfData

## Day 1: 31 Aug 2022

- setup roadmap
- Learned about structural pattern matching in python 3.10
  - `shlex.split()` - Split the string s using shell-like syntax
  - `print(f"{var!r}`") - !r calls repr instead of str
  - cons: order of patterns have effects and wicked switching -> leads to bad design decisions, fucntion starts to lose cohesion
- watched some of lecture 3 of fsdl, learned about software testing.
  - think of test suits as a classifier, outputs pass/fail
  - trade off detection and false alarms, few missed alarms and false alarms
  - 80/20 rule for testing -> only 80% of value are from 20% of effort spent on test.
  - testing tools: pytest, doctest (for documentation), codecov
  - clean code tools: black, flake8, shellcheck (shell scripting)
  - in SWE: source code -> program with compiler
  - in ML: data -> model with training (much harder to test)

## Day 3: 2 Sep 2022

- continued lecture 3
  - ML testing
    - start with testing data and checking for basic properties
    - test the training and check model is memorizing (simplest form of learning)
    - test the model itself, models are like functions, test them like functions, more advanced is to use loss values and model metrics
    - troubleshooting models
      - make it run by avoiding common errors like shape errors and OOM
      - make it fast by profiling and removing bottlenecks
      - make it right by scaling data/model
- Time series modeling in supply chain podcast
  - nested cross validation
  - intermittent time series problem
  - prediction interval
  - advice for reporting to business people: start with a punchline "my recommendation is "", this analysis shows that "" and talk about caveats and assumptions. Use the mental pyramid principle
- stats class
  - t-values = signal-to-noise ratio, used for determining statistical significance of effect size
  - SE of mean = indicates how well your sample estimate mean of population
  - [contrast](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contrast_(statistics)>) = a linear combination of variables whos coefficients add up to zero, allowing comparison of different treatments

## Day 4: 3 Sep 2022

- started MLOps zoomcamp
- fsdl lecture 4
  - a lot of ML is dealing with datasets
  - file system = fundemental unit of a "file", not versioned and easily overwritten, on a disk
  - object storage = API over filesystem, fundamental unit is an object, usually binary, versioning and redundancy built
  - database = mental model: everything is actually in RAM, but software makes sure everything is persisted to disk
  - data warehouse: store for OLAP vs database (OLTP)
    - ETL - data sources -> ETL -> warehouse
    - OLAP : column-oriented (mean length of comments past 30 days)
    - OLTP : row-oriented (comments for a given user)
  - data lake : unstructured data from different sources (eg logs, databases)
    - ELT dump everything in first
  - data lake + house = snowflake & databricks
  - airflow alternatives

## Day 5: 4 Sep 2022

- started week 2 of mlops, experiment tracking with mlflow
- AB testing podcast
  - Novelty Effect : people interacting with website/service just because it's shiny and new, causing a spike in data. Solution: use a longer test duration to allow cool down from spike of interest to ensure representative sample.
  - Cannibalization: ex: releasing a discount on blenders to people who were already going to buy blenders, pulling purchases forward
  - cohort analysis
- continuing lecture 4 fsdl : data management
  - self-supervised learning
    - use parts of data to label other parts (mask sentences and predict and take patches of images and predict relationship between patches)
    - "contrasitve" training: minimize distance between image and text caption, and maximize distance bewteen image and other text
  - data augmentations
    - image: crop, skew, flip, etc. ([torchvision](https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/index.html))
      - simCLR - used augmentation to train model without labels
    - tabular: delete some cells to simulate missing data
    - text: replace words with synonym, change order ([nlpaug](https://github.com/makcedward/nlpaug))
    - audio: change speed, insert pauses, add audio effects
  - privacy ML
    - federated learning: train global model from data on local devices without requiring access to data
    - differential privacy: aggregating data to mask individual points
    - learning on encrypted data

## Day 7: 6 Sep 2022

- Watched Lecture 1 of FSDL 2021
  - universal function approximation theoreom
    - def: give any cont. f(x), if a 2-layer NN has enough hidden units, there is a choice of Ws that allow it to approx. f(x)
    - in other words, extremenly large neural networks can represent anything
  - conditioning NNs
    - weight initialization
    - normalization
    - second order methods (computationally expensive): newton's method, natural gradient
      - adagrad, Adam approximates second order
    - automatic differentiation
      - only need to program forward function f(x, w), PyTorch automatically computes all derivatives.
  - NN architecture considerations
    - data efficiency
      - encode prior knowledge into architecture
        - CV: CNNs = spatial translation invariance (CNNs simulate how our eye works!)
        - NLP: RNN = temporal invariance (rules of language in any position of the sequence)
    - optimization landscape / conditioning
      - depth over width, skip connections, normalization
    - computational / parameter efficiency
  - CUDA = NVIDIAâ€™s language/API for programming on the graphics card

## Day 8: 7 Sep 2022

- Event logging @ airbnb
  - logs informs decision-making in business and drives product development, ex: logging events are a major source for training ML models for search ranking of listings
  - service-level agreements (SLAs) = define and measure the level of service a given vendor, product, or internal team will deliverâ€”as well as potential remedies if they fail to deliver

## Day 9: 8 Sep 2022

- Feature stores
  - a data management layer for machine learning that allows to share & discover features and create more effective machine learning pipelines.
  - they make it easy to
    - automate feature computation, backfills, logging
    - share and reuse feature pipelines across teams
    - track feature version, lineage, metadata
    - monitoring health of feature pipeline
  - main components
    - Serving: serve with high-performance API backed by low-latency database
    - Storage:
      - online : model training (months - years of data in data warehouse/lakes like S3, BigQuery)
      - offline : model serving/inference (lastest data that models the current state of the world in key-value stores like Redis, Cassandra)
    - Transformation
      - batch transform : data warehouse/lakes (ex: product category)
      - streaming transform : kafka, kinesis (ex: # of clicks in last 30 min)
      - on-demand transform : application (ex: similarity score between listing and search query or user ip) \*data available at the time of prediction
    - Monitoring
      - track data quality for drift and training-serving skew
      - monitor operational metrics (capacity on storage and throughput and latency on serving)
    - Registry : single source of truth for info about a feature
      - explore, develop, collaborate, and publish new definitions
      - schedule and configure data ingestion, transformation and storage
      - metadata for feature definition (ownership, lineage tracking)
