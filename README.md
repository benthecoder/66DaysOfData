# 66DaysOfData

## Day 1: 31 Aug 2022

- setup roadmap
- Learned about structural pattern matching in python 3.10
  - `shlex.split()` - Split the string s using shell-like syntax
  - `print(f"{var!r}`") - !r calls repr instead of str
  - cons: order of patterns have effects and wicked switching -> leads to bad design decisions, fucntion starts to lose cohesion
- watched some of lecture 3 of fsdl, learned about software testing.
  - think of test suits as a classifier, outputs pass/fail
  - trade off detection and false alarms, few missed alarms and false alarms
  - 80/20 rule for testing -> only 80% of value are from 20% of effort spent on test.
  - testing tools: pytest, doctest (for documentation), codecov
  - clean code tools: black, flake8, shellcheck (shell scripting)
  - in SWE: source code -> program with compiler
  - in ML: data -> model with training (much harder to test)

## Day 2: 1 Sep 2022

- assess multivariate normality with qq plot or Shapiro-Wilk Test
- learned about creating an R packages with devtools

## Day 3: 2 Sep 2022

- continued lecture 3
  - ML testing
    - start with testing data and checking for basic properties
    - test the training and check model is memorizing (simplest form of learning)
    - test the model itself, models are like functions, test them like functions, more advanced is to use loss values and model metrics
    - troubleshooting models
      - make it run by avoiding common errors like shape errors and OOM
      - make it fast by profiling and removing bottlenecks
      - make it right by scaling data/model
- Time series modeling in supply chain podcast
  - nested cross validation
  - intermittent time series problem
  - prediction interval
  - advice for reporting to business people: start with a punchline "my recommendation is "", this analysis shows that "" and talk about caveats and assumptions. Use the mental pyramid principle
- stats class
  - t-values = signal-to-noise ratio, used for determining statistical significance of effect size
  - SE of mean = indicates how well your sample estimate mean of population
  - [contrast](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contrast_(statistics)>) = a linear combination of variables whos coefficients add up to zero, allowing comparison of different treatments
